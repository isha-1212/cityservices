      "\n",
      "*   **Average Rent Price:** Based on the provided data, the average rent price for the properties listed is approximately **₹41,249**. (Calculated by summing the listed prices and dividing by the number of entries).\n",

      "*   **Common Localities/Areas:** The most common localities appearing in the dataset are **Shantigram**, followed by Vaishno Devi Circle, Jagatpur, Bodakdev, Makarba, Motera, Bopal and Chandkheda.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Common Property Types:** The dominant property type in this dataset is **Flat**. One listing is an Independent Builder Floor.\n",

      "**Interesting Insights:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Furnishing Preference:** While both fully furnished and semi-furnished options are available, semi-furnished properties appear to be less common.\n",
      "*   **Amenity Focus:** Security (24x7 Security) and amenities geared towards families (Children Play Area) seem to be frequently highlighted. Other common amenities include Gymnasiums, Landscaped Gardens, Parking and lifts\n",
      "*   **Size Variation:** Property sizes vary significantly, ranging from 1206 sq.ft to 4105 sq.ft, indicating a range of accommodation options.\n",
      "*   **Data Limitations:** The dataset is small, so it may not be entirely representative of the entire Ahmedabad rental market. Also, some entries have missing data (e.g., project/owner name, contact information).\n",
      "*   **Price and Size Correlation:** There's a general tendency for larger properties to command higher rents, but furnishing status, amenities, and location also play significant roles.\n",

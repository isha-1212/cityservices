      "\n",
      "**Key Findings:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Average Rent Price:**  Calculating the average rent price from the provided data:\n",
      "    (28000+50000+28000+49000+42500+37000+59990+43000+55000+25000) / 10 = 41749\n",
      "\n",
      "    **The average rent price across these listings is approximately ₹41,749.**\n",
      "*   **Common Localities/Areas:**\n",
      "    *   Shantigram appears multiple times, suggesting it's a popular area for rentals.\n",
      "    *   Other localities represented include: Vaishno Devi Circle, Jagatpur, Bodakdev, Makarba, Motera, Bopal, and Chandkheda.\n",
      "*   **Common Property Types:**\n",
      "    *   The dominant property type is \"Flat\" (Apartment).\n",
      "    *   One listing is for an \"Independent Builder Floor\".\n",
      "*   **Common Number of Bedrooms:**\n",
      "    *   3 BHK is the most frequent number of bedrooms.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Interesting Insights:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Shantigram's Popularity:**  The concentration of listings in Shantigram suggests it might be a desirable area, possibly due to amenities, proximity to services, or the type of properties available.\n",
      "*   **Variety of Amenities:**  The \"Amenities\" column shows a range of features that renters are looking for, from security and play areas to fitness facilities and convenience features like lifts and parking.\n",
      "*   **Price Range:**  The rent prices vary significantly, indicating a range of options to suit different budgets and needs.\n",
      "*   **Detailed Descriptions:**  The \"Amenities\" and \"Additional Notes\" fields (when populated) provide valuable details for potential renters, allowing them to assess if the property meets their specific requirements.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Data Consistency:** The data has some inconsistencies, such as missing values in some columns (e.g., \"Project/Owner Name,\" \"Contact / Listing Link,\" \"Additional Notes\") for several entries.  This could impact the accuracy of some analyses.\n",

      "    *   Dishes like Fries, Cheesy Burger, Steak Sandwich, Fish and Chips, Pasta Primavera, Dal Makhani, Rasmalai, Garlic Bread, Pasta Alfredo and Veg Wrap are listed.\n",
      "*   **Average Price Range:**\n",
      "\n",

      "    (138+580+692+241+606+243+301+446+359+133)/10 = 373.9\n",

      "    The average price of the listed items is approximately ₹373.9. The prices range from ₹133 to ₹692.\n",
      "*   **Rating Trends:**\n",
      "    *   The ratings range from 3.4 to 4.5.\n",
      "    *   Most items have a rating in the range of 3.5 to 4.0, suggesting a generally positive but not overwhelmingly exceptional customer experience.\n",
      "*   **Platforms Represented:**\n",
      "    *   The data is sourced from Swiggy, Zomato, and UberEats. This allows for a comparison of food offerings and pricing across different delivery platforms in Gujarat.\n",
      "*   **Cities Represented:**\n",
      "    *   The data includes information from Baroda, Surat, and Rajkot.\n",
      "*   **Missing Data:**\n",
      "    *   The provided extract only includes the first set of columns. There are a lot of columns that are empty in this data which might contain a lot of insights about the restaurant and food data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Interesting Insights:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Price Variation within Cuisines:** Noticeable price differences exist within the same cuisine. For example, prices for Continental dishes range from ₹241 to ₹692, highlighting potential variations in portion size, ingredients, or restaurant quality.\n",
      "*   **Platform Specialization:** Analyzing which platforms are more prevalent in each city or for certain cuisine types might reveal platform specialization or regional preferences.\n",
      "*   **Potential for Menu Analysis:** This data can be expanded to understand the menu composition of different restaurants, identify popular menu items, and understand the pricing strategies of restaurants in Gujarat.\n",
      "*   **Impact of Ratings on Price:** Further investigation could explore if there is a correlation between customer ratings and the price of dishes.\n",

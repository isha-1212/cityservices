If backend present, fetch /api/dashboard/summary.
Data shapes (canonical)
Service

{ id: string, name: string, city: string, category: string, description?: string, price_min?: number, price_max?: number, rating?: number, images?: string[], metadata?: object, created_at?: string }
Bookmark (server)

{ id: number, user_id: number, service_id: string, meta?: object, created_at: string }
User

{ id: number, name: string, email: string }
API error

{ error: { code: string, message: string } }
Bookmark behavior & sync strategy
Offline / logged-out:
Maintain local_bookmarks (Array<string>). UI reads this for bookmarked state.
Logged-in:
Server is authoritative. When user logs in:
Option A (simple): don't auto-merge; keep server list only.
Option B (recommended): fetch server bookmarks, find local_bookmarks not present, call either POST /api/bookmarks per id or a batch endpoint to create them, then clear local_bookmarks (or keep as cached copy). Handle conflicts via unique constraint.
Implementation notes:
Keep bookmark_map (service_id → bookmark_id) in memory for quick DELETE mapping.
Backend should have UNIQUE(user_id, service_id).
UX & accessibility
Keyboard navigation for cards and bookmark buttons.
Screen-reader labels for interactive controls.
Announce state changes (toast/ARIA-live) for bookmark add/remove and form submissions.
Mobile-first: cards stack, filters collapse into a modal/accordion on small screens.
Network UX (performance & reliability)
Debounce search input (300ms).
Paginate results; server returns meta.total.
Optimistic UI for bookmark toggle (apply UI change immediately, revert on server error).
Cache service list pages in memory to support back/forward navigation without re-fetch.
Testing suggestions (what to test)
Unit: ServiceCard, bookmark toggle logic, utils (debounce, api wrapper).
Integration: ServiceSearch fetch + filters producing correct API calls.
End-to-end: Login → bookmark sync → ensure server record created.
Accessibility checks: keyboard, ARIA labels, color contrast.
